                <p id="brown-p">Brown bears, also known as grizzly bears in certain regions, are large and powerful mammals found in North America. These bears are typically characterized by their thick brown fur, prominent shoulder hump, and large claws. In North America, brown bears primarily inhabit Alaska, Canada, and parts of the northern Rocky Mountains.</p>

                <p>Brown bears are among the largest land mammals, with males typically weighing between 600 to 1,500 pounds, while females are generally smaller. In some cases, particularly in coastal areas where food is abundant, males can grow even larger, reaching up to 2,000 pounds. Adult male brown bears can stand over 8 feet tall when on their hind legs and measure up to 10 feet in length. </p>

                <p>Several national parks in North America are home to brown bears. In Alaska, Katmai National Park and Denali National Park are famous for their large populations of brown bears, with Katmai being especially known for its bears that congregate around the Brooks River to fish for salmon. In the lower 48 states, brown bears are found in Yellowstone National Park, which spans Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, and is home to both grizzly bears and black bears. Glacier National Park in Montana also provides a habitat for brown bears, as well as parts of the Olympic National Park in Washington. These parks are vital sanctuaries, offering safe environments for brown bears to thrive in the wild.</p>
