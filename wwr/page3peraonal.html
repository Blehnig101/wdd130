                <p>Black bears are the most widespread bear species in North America, known for their generally smaller size and versatile diet. Despite their name, black bears can range in color from black to brown, cinnamon, or even blonde. These adaptable creatures can be found in forests, swamps, and mountainous regions across much of the continent, from Canada to Mexico. In the U.S., they inhabit nearly every state, with significant populations in the forests of the Appalachian Mountains, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and parts of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

                <p>Black bears are generally smaller than their brown bear relatives, but they can still grow quite large. Adult male black bears typically weigh between 200 to 600 pounds, while females are usually smaller, ranging from 100 to 300 pounds. The largest black bears, particularly those in the northern parts of North America, can exceed 700 pounds, with some exceptional individuals reaching over 800 pounds. When standing on their hind legs, they can measure up to 8 feet tall.</p>

                <p>Black bears are found in many national parks across North America. They are especially abundant in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which straddles the border between North Carolina and Tennessee and is home to one of the largest populations of black bears in the eastern U.S. Other parks like Yosemite National Park in California, Acadia National Park in Maine, and Shenandoah National Park in Virginia also provide critical habitats for black bears. They are commonly seen in the forests, wetlands, and mountainous areas of these parks, where they forage for a variety of food including berries, nuts, and small mammals.</p>
